 🏗 Architecture

EduSphere follows a **Microservices Architecture**, where each core functionality is separated into independent services.

🔹 Services

* **Auth Service** → User authentication & role management
* **Course Service** → Course creation & management
* **Enrollment Service** → Course enrollment & tracking
* **Payment Service** → Course purchasing logic
* **User Service** → Profile & dashboard management

Each service:

* Has its own controller, routes, and database logic
* Communicates via REST APIs
* Can be scaled independently

🔒 Security Features

* JWT Access + Refresh Token implementation
* Role-based API access (Student / Instructor / Admin)
* Request validation using Zod
* Centralized error handling
* Logging using Winston
